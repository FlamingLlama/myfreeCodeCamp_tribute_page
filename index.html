          <p>No-one expected Niki Lauda to survive his crash at the 1976 German Grand Prix, which left him trapped in a burning cockpit for 55 seconds.</p>
          <p>Niki Lauda was a Austrian race car driver, who won three F1 Grand Prix world championships in 1975, 1977 and 1984. Lauda was born into a wealthy family who disapproved of his interest in racing. Despite his family's disapproval, he began racing Minis in 1968, then moviung up to Formula Vee and then Formula Three. In 1971, Lauda secured a loan against his life insurance in order to buy his way into a Formula Two team.</p>
          <p>Lauda's F1 career began in 1973, when he join the British Racing Motors team. In 1974 he signed with Scuderia Ferrari; the year in which he finished the season in fourth place. Winning five races in 1975, Niki captured his first world championship. </p>
          <p>In the 1976 racing season, by the ninth race, Lauda had won five of the races and had more than twice as many points in the standings as his closest competitor. Lauda tried to get the other drivers to boycott the 10th race of the season, the German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring, because of safety concerns. In the second lap of the race, Lauda lost control of the car and crashed into an embankment. Lauda ended up being trapped in the car for nearly a minute. Despite suffering substantial burns to his scalp and body, he was able to return to racing later on in the season. James Hunt ended up winning the 1976 championship by only one point.</p>
          <p>Niki won another championship in 1977, however due to team tension, he left F1 in 1979.
